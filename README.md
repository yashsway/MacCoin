# MacCoin

A viral web application for a fake cryptocurrency. Built, amidst cryptocurrency craze of 2018, over the course of 24 hours as a send-off prank from McMaster's Software Engineering class of 2018, MacCoin was a web application that playfully simulated the crypto experience for students across McMaster's campus. MacCoin offered users the ability to mine and transfer coins amongst themselves. A live leaderboard was included to showcase which faculty factions had amassed the most MacCoin. While only truly living for a period of a few days, MacCoin boasted 2,712 unique wallets, 840 transactions, and 4,737,081,027 mined coins.
